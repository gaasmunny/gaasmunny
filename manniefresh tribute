  <P>Hello!</p>
  <p>You have came across this page because of your love of the bounce music king, Mannie Fresh! Not only is Mannie the best producer of all time, but also he has the most manicured Mini fro in existance.</P>
  <p>You know most people seem to think that mannie has only made tracks for Cash money records artist, but they are wrong. so so very wrong.</p>
  <p>For instance did you know he made the song "give it back" by Toni Braxton? The song "still in love" by the late Teena Marie? what about "the one" from GOOD Music's Cruel summer album? Huh? What? I can't hear you over all his accomplishments.</p>
